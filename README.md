# Visualize Global Earthquake Data
Earthquakes occurring globally using a live API feed provided by the USGS(United States Geological Survey). The USGS is responsible for providing scientific data about natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and environment; and the impacts of climate and land-use change. The data in the feed is updated every 5 mins, and includes earthquakes over 2.5 scale for the Past 7 Days.
